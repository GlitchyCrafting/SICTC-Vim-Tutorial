# Prerequisites

### Key

This key is the same as used in the Vim docs

- `<key>`: Key with special name
- `<C-key>`: CTRL+key
- `<S-key>`: Shift+key (only used for special characters)
- `<A-key>`: ALT+key
- `<CR>`: Enter key
- `{thing}`: Required
- `[thing]`: Optional

### Installation

Run the following command to make sure everything we need is installed:
```bash
sudo apt-get install vim fzf curl
```

- `vim`: Second only to NeoVim
- `fzf`: A fuzzy finder with Vim integration
- `curl`: Allows downloading stuff from the terminal

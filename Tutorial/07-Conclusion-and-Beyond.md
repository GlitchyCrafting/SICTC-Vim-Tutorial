# Conclusion and Beyond

Now you have a _mostly_ fully-featured Vim config.
There are [many more plugins](https://vimawesome.com) you can add and many more keybinds you can learn, but configuring Vim is time-consuming.
It's also difficult due to lack of documentation, not to mention how non-user-friendly Vimscript is.

The altenative is to use [NeoVim](https://neovim.io), it's configured in [Lua](https://lua.org) and has many more plugins than Vim.
It's also been rewritten in many places to make it more preformant and easier to develop.

Anyway, this is the end of Vim for SICTC.
I hope you learned something, or at least got a decent config to build off of.
